# Temperature 1

Results for running the experiments with sampling temperature = 1.

Whatâ€™s here
- Subfolders: `heart_disease`, `heart_disease_minimal`, `house_prices`, `house_prices_minimal`, `income`, `income_minimal`.
- Each subfolder contains a `llama3_3_70B.json` exemplar that is tracked in the repo. Other model results can be regenerated locally if needed.

Reproducing
- Use `src/main.py` to generate results and set the output path to the relevant `analysis/temperature_1/<dataset>` directory.
