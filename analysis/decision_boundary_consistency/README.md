# Decision Boundary Consistency

Code and artifacts for the decision boundary consistency experiment.

Whatâ€™s here
- `main_log_probs.py` and `log_probs_useful_functions.py` for running the experiment.
- `decision_boundary.ipynb` for inspection/plotting.
- Example aggregates like `average_50.json` (larger raw results can be regenerated).

Reproducing
- Regenerate results by running `main_log_probs.py` and process in the notebook as needed.
