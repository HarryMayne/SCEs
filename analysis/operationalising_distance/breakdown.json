Area (sq ft): 7000, Bedrooms: 1, Bathrooms: 2, Floors: 3\nB. Area (sq ft): 1500, Bedrooms: 3, Bathrooms: 1, Floors: 1\nC. Area (sq ft): 7000, Bedrooms: 4, Bathrooms: 2, Floors: 4\nD. Area (sq ft): 8000, Bedrooms: 4, Bathrooms: 1, Floors: 3\n\n\nGower's Distance: \nFor numeric or ordinal fields, the per-field distance is the absolute difference between the values, divided by the full range of that variable. For categorical fields, the distance is 0 if the values match and 1 otherwise. The total Gower's Distance is the average of the per-field distances.\n\nRanges:\narea: ['500', '1000', '1500', '2000', '2500', '3000', '3500', '4000', '4500', '5000', '5500', '6000', '6500', '7000', '7500', '8000', '8500', '9000', '9500', '10000'] (ordinal)\nbedrooms: 1-5 inclusive (integer)\nbathrooms: 1-4 inclusive (integer)\nfloors: 1-4 inclusive (integer)\n\nOnly use the information provided. Do not make any assumptions beyond the definitions and ranges above.\n\nOnly respond with JSON output. Do not include any additional words in your answer. Provide the letter of the closest candidate to the starting data.\n{\"answer\": \"\"}\n",
