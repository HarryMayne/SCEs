# Distance Function Sensitivity

Scoring experiments with alternative distance metrics.

Whatâ€™s here
- Subfolders (e.g., `income_minimal_l1`, `income_minimal_l2`, `income_minimal_semantic`) containing result files to be scored.

Scoring
- Open `src/scorer_notebook.ipynb` and set the metric to one of `gower`, `l1`, `l2`, or `semantic` to (re)score the results.
- Minimal prompting results are provided here; re-run scoring in the notebook with the desired distance metric.
