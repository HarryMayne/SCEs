Figures Notebooks

- 2D_vis_clean.ipynb
  - Main notebook for producing the decision‑boundary visualizations used in the paper (Figure 1 and related panels).
  - Uses precomputed results and distance matrices from the repository; paths are relative to the repo root.

- scatter.ipynb
  - Generates the validity–minimality scatter plots.
  - Produces the scatter figures referenced as Figure 2 (main paper) and Figure 12 (appendix).

Notes

- The legacy draft notebook 2D_vis.ipynb is intentionally ignored by git (see repo .gitignore).
- To regenerate figures, ensure required results files exist under results/ and run the notebooks top‑to‑bottom.
